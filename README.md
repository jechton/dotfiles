# dotfiles

Managed with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io).

## Notes

Before the first run, I currently have to run `sudo chmod a+w /etc/yum.repos.d/`. This can be reverted after the first run with `sudo chmod 755 /etc/yum.repos.d`.

## Credits

A lot of the scripts/parts of scripts were sourced from [felipecrs's dotfiles on GitHub](https://github.com/felipecrs/dotfiles).
